# Fastboot EFI application

*fastboot.efi* is an implementation of a subset of the fastboot protocol as a
standalone EFI application, for the purpose of enabling workflows using
*fastboot boot* for e.g. rapid kernel development in environments that doesn't
already provide fastboot support. It also has a more optimistic memory
allocation policy, allowing for booting large images.

*fastboot.efi* supports booting abootimg v2 and PE32+ (EFI) images.

Supported fastboot commands are **boot**, **continue**, and **reboot**.

## Building

Use *rustup* to install the aarch64-unknown-uefi target. Then build using:

```
cargo build --target aarch64-unknown-uefi
```

## Deploying

The resulting *fastboot.efi* can be loaded by normal means of loading EFI
applications, such as chainloading from systemd-boot/grub or placed as
*\EFI\boot\bootaa64.efi*.

### Generating disk image

To further simplify bootstrapping processes of a device for development
purposes, *fastboot.efi* can be packaged in an EFI System Partition (esp),
wrapped by a GPT header using the included repart.d configuration and the
following command:

```
systemd-repart fastboot-nvme-disk.img --empty=create --size=64M --definitions=repart.d --root=$PWD
```
or:
```
systemd-repart fastboot-ufs-disk.img --empty=create --size=512M --sector-size=4096 --definitions=repart.d --root=$PWD
```

These files can be written straight to a NVMe or UFS device, starting at sector
0, using e.g. **qdl**, e.g.:


```
qdl prog_firehose_ddr.elf --storage ufs write 0 fastboot-ufs-disk.img
```

Upon booting the device will automatically enter fastboot mode.

## *fastboot boot* an UKI (or other EFI application)

The standard *fastboot* host tool, will upon invoking *fastboot boot* wrap the
provided non-abootimg file in an abootimg format before downloading and booting
it on the device.

By using a "non-standard" *fastboot* host tool, that downloads the file
provided as is, *fastboot.efi* allows booting arbitrary EFI applications, such
as Unified Kernel Images (UKI).
